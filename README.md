# GA_LinkedList_ArmanSahota
A linked list is a dynamic data structure where elements (nodes) are connected linearly (or in one way) offering advantages such as efficient insertion and deletion, dynamic sizing, and memory efficiency. Proper referencing is crucial to prevent issues like memory leaks and inconsistent data access. Linked lists are beneficial for systems with dynamic data changes, prioritizing quick insertion over fast searching, such as real-time or task scheduling systems. In scenarios where searching is more critical than adding, arrays or dynamic arrays like Lists in C# are more suitable. To enhance efficiency, a hybrid approach can be considered, incorporating an index or reference structure alongside a linked list for faster searches while retaining the benefits of quick insertion and deletion.
